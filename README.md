Informationsvisualisierung nichtübertragbarer Krankheiten und ihrer Risikofaktoren

Abstract:

In our work we focus on the graphic visualization of health and economic
data or, more precisely, on the information visualization of noncommunicable
diseases and their risk factors. This area of research is useful for understan-
ding the general structure and kind of abstract data, as well as the associa-
tions between different variables. In addition, human cognition is supported
and reinforced by the graphic representation. In order to create a successful
data visualization from which one can gain knowledge, certain steps must be
followed.
In the thesis we considered the reference model of information visualiza-
tion, which contains the following components: data transformation, visual
mapping and view transformation. The data transformation is an important
part of the model. You can only start with the visual representation after
you have familiarized yourself with the data and put it into a structured
form. The second part of the reference model is the actual graphic visuali-
zation of the processed data. The data for the graph relate on the one hand
to the worldwide development of the mortality rate from noncommunicable
diseases for certain points in time, and on the other hand to the worldwide
development of the numbers of health and economic risk factors for the same
points in time. In order to show the relationships between noncommunicable
diseases and their risk factors for countries over the years, we should use com-
plex illustrations. The complex images make it possible to visualize several
pieces of information on one view, but there is a risk of overloading human
perception. To avoid this problem, we used various information visualization
techniques, such as color or interaction. For the last step of the reference mo-
del, we implemented a web-based interactive application that contains visual
representations from the previous step.
In order to evaluate the used information visualization methods, we de-
signed a survey. From their results we were able to answer the following
questions:

• Can the examined group gain the desired knowledge from the repre-
sentations?

• Are there graphics that lead to cognitive loads?

• Do dynamic graphics help to facilitate visual perception compared to
static ones?
